Python 3.7.1.0 project for UNECON. RSS Reader
1. If any of the modules listed at the beginning of the code is not installed (for example, pyperclip or feedparser) - install it through cmd using pip in the scripts folder.
2. Run the file "data.py" - it is designed to create a db-file in which rss-channels will be written.
3. Run "rss.py" - a program will open consisting of a window with three buttons with inscriptions in English inside.
And now more about the insides:
1. After launch, we are horrified to find that the news window in the middle (oh, horror) is empty. Do not despair - this is due to the fact that the db file that we created is still empty. In order to fix this, we need to do the following:
2. Open the "Source Administration" tab and add some rss channel (for example, https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/.rss). After that we can climb on "Watch all" and watch how much news we have in the feed.
3. In addition, the programâ€™s functionality includes searching for news by keywords ("Search at list" tab), deleting channels and copying their http-addresses.
